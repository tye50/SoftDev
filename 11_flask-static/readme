Opening the app.py link at first will return "No hablo queso!". 

I uncommented the code in app.py and then opened the link in foo.html
and saw "0.7144435224241726". When I opened the link in the foo file, 
it downloaded a file called "foo" which was just another copy of the 
foo file. 

I recommented the code in app.py and reopened the website to find the 
message, "Is this plaintext, though?". When the code is uncommented,
it returns a random float number. 

You can change the route in the @app.route() line to change from what
file code is ran and returned. 

----

@app.route(str) will display whatever is in the function defined under the route inside MAIN
/static/.html will return whatever is in that html file (not what is in MAIN)!
