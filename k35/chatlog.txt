Can you create a flask app inside a python file called "__init__.py" that serves a html page with buttons that allow you to log in, register a new account, and log out

Can you add the logic into "__init__.py" so that users who have not registered cannot log in? Please store inside a SQLITE3 database

Please update the files so that when the user tries to log in without having registers, it will send a flash message prompting them to register an account first and redirect the user to the register page

In line 40 of the python file, an error is generated because you did not reopen the database before accessing it. please fix this

Please update the html files so that the flash messages will appear

Once users are logged in, their page should have a button that allows them to create a new blog with is added into a seperate table in the database. The blog should allow the user to enter a blog title and contents
