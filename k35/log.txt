DISCO:

Q/C/C:
some areas of interest...
q0: How many tries did it take to "get it right?"
q1: Did you catch any errors? If so, how did you notice, and what did you do?
q2: How similar or different is the bot's output to that of your past self / old team?

- It imported the necessary modules (including sessions, which we did not ask for)
- When prompted to use SQLITE3, it added flash messages
- Created an error (purple screen of death!!) by not reopening the database after closing it (in the if statement)
- When prompted to add flash messages, it will only update the python file unless specifically prompted to also update the HTML files
- When I put multiple steps in at once while using transition words (first, next, then, finally), it ignored the command after the "finally" instruction.
