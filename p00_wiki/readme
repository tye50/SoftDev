## P00: Half-Quick
### Due: TBD
### Design Document Due: `2024-10-22t 08:00EST`

_Imagine:_

_Your team advertises proficiency with Flask, Python, and SQLite.
Your team has been contracted to design and implement a newfangled webapp called a "wiki."_

----- 

Your "software solution," to use the parlance of our times, will incorporate a few distinct components, so it is imperative that your team develop a design before taking any further steps.
<br>
<br>
Your team's first order of business is reaching agreement as to how your project will be organized and how you will divide work. It will be imperative that each teammate a) shares the same organizational model of your target, and b) <br>
understands how they and their work will fit into it.
<br>
<br>
Enter the _design document_. Design by next class session.
<br>
<br>
(___Nota bene:___ _This is your only deliverable for next class. All your efforts should be directed to doing this job well._)

##### Design Document Specifications:
- A *list* of program components with role of each specified. (e.g., a car engine is comprised of various components: carburetor, alternator, radiator, spark plugs, etc. Each must perform its role for the engine to do its overall job.)
- Explanation of how each component relates to the others.
  - Component map visualizing relationships between components.
- Database Organization (tables? Relationships b/t tables? etc.)
- Site map for front end
  - Represent each page you envision for your site.
  - Show linkages conveying all possilbe pathways for a user traversing site.
- A breakdown of the different tasks required to complete this project
  - Include assignments of each task to each group member
- Append this line to your heading: **`TARGET SHIP DATE: {yyyy-mm-dd}`**
- Amalgamate these components into a single PDF, store in designated location.

##### Project Guidelines:
* Flask will serve as your web server/delivery framework.
* SQLite3 will serve as your backend data storage system.
  - As you grown your "sql-fu", always start with Devo Knowledge Base (QAF, n&c) and primary documentation. (...and if none of these have the answer you seek, and you find a SO post that is actually useful, or any other diamond in the rough of the Intertrash, add it to Devo KB)
  - Get creative, think boldly, get your hands dirty as you experiment via the sqlite3 shell and see what works/sticks...
* Multiple Python files should be used, as necessary, for application layer. (_a.k.a._ "middleware" modules, etc.)
* CSS: If your team decides to implement CSS, your site must deliver full functionality, as intended, with CSS is stripped away.
* Use Q&A forum liberally. *"A rising tide lifts all boats."*
* _Reminder:_ include heading as comment in all source files.
* Platinum Rule: __THOUST APP SHALT NOT FAIL.__

Your website will incorporate a few distinct components, so it is imperative that your team develop a design and agree upon roles ___before___ you move to implementation.

##### DELIVERABLES:
* PDF in appropriate location (identical for each teammate)
* Bring hardcopy to class. (3x/team)
