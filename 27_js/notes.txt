K27 - Basic functions in JavaScript
2025-01-06m

NOTES ::
- - - 
    Open Dev Console (to run javascript) useing ctrl+shift+K
    Parathesis around *everything* in scheme

    function foo(n){
        return 2n+1;
    }
        ---> undefined

    foo
        ---> function foo(n)			[dropdown of more information abt function]

    foo(1)
        ---> 3

    Syntax is just like Java
    Redeclaring overrides the last function of the same name

Q ::
- - - 
    Pressing 'enter' to move on to the next section of the code (ex: multiple if-statements) automatically ends the function. To prevent that, must shift+enter. But then the indenting is off. Very inconvenient, how to do more easily?
